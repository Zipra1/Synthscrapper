b.This repo is a game for my Grade 12 CS class.

c.By the middle of June, I expect to have:
- Player movement system
- Completed enemy system with a few different enemy types
- Completed map loading system
- One boss
- A few levels of progress (Spear --> + Receiver --> +Gun/Bow --> etc...)
- A small town area (but might not actually do anything, just a place where enemies can't go)

d.It will be written likely entirely in python, using the pymunk (chipmunk) physics engine and pyglet for rendering.
