This repo is a game for my Grade 12 CS class.

By the middle of June, I expect to have:
- Player movement system (DONE)
- Completed enemy system with a few different enemy types
- Completed map loading system
- One boss
- A few levels of progress (Spear --> + Receiver --> +Gun/Bow --> etc...) (SPEAR COMPLETED)
- A small town area (but might not actually do anything, just a place where enemies can't go)

It will be written likely entirely in python, using the pymunk (chipmunk) physics engine and pyglet for rendering.
