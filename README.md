b.This repo is a game for my Grade 12 CS class.

c.By the middle of June, I expect this project to be a short playable demo with 1 boss, a few enemies, a medium sized world,
and one special area (dungeon-like area), all sprites, animations, and textures "good enough".

d.It will be written likely entirely in python, using the pymunk (chipmunk) physics engine and pyglet for rendering.
